# COMPROMISING WORDPRESS INSTALATIONS

## Reconnaissance
## Scanning and Enumeration

### wordpress core version enumeration
You can reference all wordpress version [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-versions/)

you can use this techniques 
1. checking the html source tag for a meta generator in the HEAD section of a HTML source 
here is an example from default wordpress version 3.5.2
```html
    <meta name="generator" content="WordPress 3.5.2" />
```
2. in readme.html
check for version in /readme.html from root directory
**NOTE: newer versions of WordPress have removed the version from the file.**

3. viewing the HTML source of the site
```html
```
4. by using tools such as wpscan
```
$ wpscan --api-token <API-TOKEN>  --url  <http://www.example.com>

## sample output

 |  - https://www.example.com/wp-admin/load-styles.php, Match: '6.3.5'

 |  - https://www.example.com/wp-includes/css/dashicons.min.css?ver=6.3.5
 |  - https://www.example.com/wp-includes/css/buttons.min.css?ver=6.3.5

```


### wordpress theme enumeration
Plugins may contain vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to comprimise .more complex themes have more included components and likely to introduce some vulnerabilities

plugins can be detected by inspecting the source file and brute forcing or using wpscan

### users enumeration
user enumeration can be achieved by brute forcing using scripts or burp suite intruder.
sample one 
```
$ curl http://www.target.com/?author={payload}
```
payload here can be a number(eg 1,2 ...) or usernames(eg admin, etc)

an web page that is vulnerable to user enumeration( can be e)
<insert a page here later>


2. Users listed in JSON API Endpoint
a json endpoint may get a list of users on the site
```bash
    curl http://target.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users
```
